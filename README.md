This project was created as part of my high school journey into cybersecurity.

its focuses on understanding backdoor mechanisms, remote control principles, and the basics of persistence and evasion.

The goal is purely educational: to gain hands-on experience with offensive security tools and learn how such mechanisms work so they can be defended against.

⚠️ Intended for use in secure, isolated environments only (e.g., virtual machines).

Built to learn. Not to harm.
